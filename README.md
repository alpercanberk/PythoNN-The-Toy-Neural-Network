# PythoNN-The-Toy-Neural-Network

The neural network class is initialized with layer_array and learning_rate variables

Example: a four layered neural network with 4 input nodes, 2 hidden layers with 2 nodes, and a learning rate of 1 is initialized with by writing `nn = NeuralNetwork([4,2,2,1],1)` in the program
